    Chandler Muriel Bing (born 1967/1968)[2] is a fictional character from the
    NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by actor Matthew Perry.[3] Chandler was born
    to Nora Tyler Bing, an erotic romance novelist, and Charles Bing, a gay
    female impersonator and star of a Las Vegas drag show called "Viva Las
    Gay-gas" as Helena Handbasket. Chandler is of Scottish and Swedish
    descent.[citation needed] He is an only child and is apparently from an
    affluent family.[citation needed] His parents announced their divorce to him
    over Thanksgiving dinner when Chandler was nine years old, an event which
    gave him trauma and now he refuses to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood
    and led him to develop his notorious sense of humor as a defense mechanism.
    <p>
    It is revealed in season 1 that he went to an all-boys high school.
    Chandler's best friends are Joey Tribbiani, who is his roommate, and Ross
    Geller, with whom he previously lived. He met Ross' sister, Monica Geller,
    and her friend, Rachel Green, while celebrating Thanksgiving at Ross'
    parents' house. Chandler was the first person to know about Ross' love for
    Rachel.[citation needed] He moved to New York City and lives across the hall
    from Monica and, through her, meets Phoebe Buffay. Chandler has a very good
    sense of humor, and is notoriously sarcastic. He attributes his sarcasm as a
    defense mechanism he developed due to his parents' divorcing when he was a
    child. He is the highest earning member of his friends' circle on account of
    responsible income management, having learned the value of money from a
    young age.[citation needed] He suffers from commitment issues, but later
    marries Monica at the end of season 7. In season 10, Chandler and Monica go
    on to adopt twins, Jack and Erica. His birthday is celebrated on the 8th of
    April, even though there are misconceptions that it is on the 24th of April.

    <h2>Appearances</h2>
    Chandler works in 'Statistical analysis and Data reconfiguration,' but
    loathes it, although it pays well.[4] Chandler was Ross Geller's roommate in
    college. Chandler met his future wife Monica Geller while celebrating
    Thanksgiving with the Geller family during his first year at college. On a
    tip from Monica, Chandler later moved to Apartment number 19 in Greenwich
    Village, Manhattan, across the hall from Monica and her roommate Phoebe
    Buffay. After his roommate Kip moves out, actor Joey Tribbiani moves in with
    Chandler, who becomes his best friend. Ross and Chandler have been best
    friends since their freshman year in college, where they were roommates.
    They were in a band together. Chandler also learned "Hug and Roll" from Ross
    when he was dating Janice.[5] Until moving in with Monica, Chandler shared
    an apartment with Joey. Chandler and Joey's apartment is an important focal
    point for the series as one of the few meeting areas of the gang. The two
    form a close and enduring friendship, and get into many humorous situations.
    In the pilot episode of the sequel series Joey, Joey's sister Gina briefly
    expresses her belief that Joey and Chandler were a gay couple. When Chandler
    first meets Joey and interviews him as a roommate, the two start off on the
    wrong foot when Joey says that he "is cool with the gay thing" (Joey
    assuming that Chandler is gay). Chandler initially chooses Eric, a fashion
    photographer with a porn-star sister as his roommate, but after their
    eccentric neighbor Mr. Heckles (Larry Hankin) tells Eric that he is
    Chandler's new roommate and is able to open Chandler's unlocked door, Eric
    leaves. Chandler assumes that Eric simply did not turn up, and he gives the
    keys to Joey, but soon finds that they have a lot in common, including a
    fondness for Baywatch and beer. Chandler often supports Joey throughout the
    show, by always supporting Joey at every step of his roller-coaster of a
    career in show business besides paying the rent, paying for Joey's
    head-shots, buying most of the food, and even giving money to Joey for his
    numerous dates. Even when buying a new house for his own family, Chandler
    reveals that he is going to have a 'Joey room' in it for him. The
    relationship between the two is balanced: Joey looks to Chandler as his
    intellectual superior, while Chandler acknowledges Joey as the more
    confident counterpart, especially when it comes to romance and Chandler
    often takes advice from Joey on how to date women. Chandler and Rachel
    originally did not like each other, but grew to become good friends. Rachel
    does not understand Chandler's sarcasm early in the series, and even later
    on has a hard time appreciating his sense of humor, as she acknowledges in
    the final episode. In "The One with All the Cheesecakes" Chandler and Rachel
    steal and share the cheesecake which originally belonged to their downstairs
    neighbor. Rachel, who works for Ralph Lauren, is also the one who helps
    Chandler pick out his wedding suit. Rachel also sets up Chandler with her
    boss Joanna (Alison LaPlaca). Rachel and Chandler never have any romantic
    relationships apart from a glance back to their time in college when they
    made out. In "The One with the Flashback," Rachel is shown briefly
    fantasizing about Chandler at the end of the episode. Chandler and Phoebe
    are good friends. Although Phoebe mocks Chandler frequently, they sometimes
    are goofy and have fun with one another. In "The One with the Metaphorical
    Tunnel", Phoebe and Chandler play hide and seek. They also play games, like
    coming up with superhero names and reclining the Barcaloungers like cowboys.
    They share a duet of "Endless Love" at the end of one episode, when Chandler
    is sad after a breakup with his on-off girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler).
    In "The One Where Everyone Finds Out", she tries to trick him into believing
    that she is attracted to him, but Monica tells him that Phoebe finds him
    charming in a "sexless" way, indicating that any hints of romance are jokes.
    Phoebe is the initial reason that Chandler quit smoking in "The One with the
    Thumb", after an argument between the group about his smoking. He is leaving
    the apartment when she offers him $7,000 to never smoke again. Chandler is
    brash, zany, and estranged from both of his parents. He suffers from
    commitment issues, brought on by growing up in a broken home with no idea of
    what a stable marriage looks like, can be neurotic and extremely defensive,
    with humor as his shield. Chandler also views everything associated with his
    parents' divorce in a negative light, specifically Thanksgiving when his
    parents revealed their separation over a turkey as his father planned to run
    away with the bus boy. Both of Chandler's parents are extremely promiscuous,
    and he has made several allusions to having caught them during sexual acts.
    Most of these involve his father with other men. Among other things, he
    alludes to having witnessed orgies by the time he was seven years old, and
    playing "the far left" background dancer during his father's rendition of
    It's Raining Men when he was growing up. His mother Nora is a world famous
    writer of erotic novels, which is demonstrated when Rachel's short-term

    <p>Chandler has been Ross Geller's best friend since college. He met Ross'
        sister Monica Geller and her friend Rachel Greene while celebrating
        Thanksgiving 1987 at the Geller family residence during his first year at
        college. He later moved to apartment #19 in New York City, across the hall
        from Monica and later Rachel. At some point during this time, Phoebe Buffay
        moved in with Monica and Kip became Chandler's roommate. Kip and Monica
        dated for a while, but later broke up, and could no longer stand to be in
        the same room as each other. Chandler's next roommate, Joey Tribbiani moved
        in, and completed the group of friends. Chandler lived with Joey until
        season 6, then he moved in with Monica, whom he had been dating for a year.
        Chandler is the wealthiest friend because he has been saving money from his
        job for the last six years. He gets mad when Monica expects him to spend his
        savings on her dream wedding, convincing her that they should save the money</p>

    for their life after the wedding, which Monica eventually agrees to. Because
    of the Thursday night line-up that led with Friends, Thanksgiving was always
    an important episode for the series. Chandler's most vivid memory of
    Thanksgiving is when he was nine and his parents told him they were getting
    divorced so his father could run off with the house-boy. Because of this,
    Chandler refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving in the traditional way. This
    includes a ban on all Thanksgiving food, as he insists that it's not as good
    after seeing a Thanksgiving dinner in reverse. His Thanksgiving dinner
    consists of tomato soup, grilled cheese sandwiches, and a family-size bag of
    Funyuns. Several Thanksgiving episodes include retelling this backstory of
    Chandler's home life and his hatred of the holiday. Joey goes so far as to
    say, "It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!" Later
    on, perhaps thanks to his more positive view of family events due to his
    relationship with Monica, he accepts Thanksgiving. He still refuses to eat
    the actual food, even when dining with his friends, eating chicken instead
    of turkey and other things of that nature. Chandler visits the Geller
    household for Thanksgiving again in 1988, slightly dismissed by Judy, Ross
    and Monica's mother, because he does not eat any Thanksgiving food. While
    attempting to get back at Chandler for calling her fat the previous year,
    Monica accidentally dropped a knife through Chandler's wicker shoes.
    Chandler lost most of the pinkie toe on his right foot because it couldn't
    be replaced, due to the fact that Monica accidentally brought a baby carrot
    to the hospital instead of the toe. This incident led Ross to call Chandler
    Sir Limps-a-Lot. Chandler is not aware that it was Monica's revenge-gone-bad
    that caused him to lose his toe until she tells him during Thanksgiving
    dinner ("The One With All The Thanksgivings"). Monica reveals that Chandler
    has a third nipple (which Chandler describes as a nubbin) after she learns
    that Chandler told Phoebe about her having sex with Fun Bobby on the
    balcony. The friends are amused at the secret, and they tease Chandler about
    it. Finally, Chandler has the nubbin surgically removed after Ginger, a
    would-be lover, is repulsed by it. Chandler was a bed-wetter as a child.
    While supporting Rachel during her parents' divorce, he jokingly recommends
    the, "carefully regimented program of denial ... and, and wetting the bed,"
    which he himself relied on as a child ("The One With The Two Parties").
    Throughout the run of the show, Chandler comments how much he dislikes
    physical exercise. However, he is often seen enjoying Knicks games with Joey
    and Ross. He also enjoys watching ice hockey, football, and baseball. He
    even enjoys racquetball. It's often alluded that Chandler doesn't really
    enjoy these things; he just wants to seem like one of the guys. In Season
    10, it is revealed that he once tried out for his high school figure-skating
    team, much to the amusement of Phoebe and Ross. On Thanksgiving, he enters
    the room saying he wants to watch football. Phoebe responds, "It's okay.
    Ross and Joey aren't here. You can watch the parade if you want." Chandler
    demonstrates excellent tennis skills and ping pong skills, the latter he
    hides from Monica due to her childish competitiveness. Although it became
    less noticeable during the course of the show, Chandler has the habit of
    accenting the wrong words in his sentences. This leads to his friends and
    colleagues imitating his speech pattern. Early Life Chandler Muriel Bing is
    the son of erotic novelist Nora Tyler Bing and cross-dressing burlesque star
    Charles "Helena Handbasket" Bing, who performs his all-male burlesque show,
    'Viva Las Gay-gas' in Las Vegas, where they live. At the age of 9, his
    parents announced their divorce leaving him distraught and alarmed. Due to
    this, he resorted to what he calls "a carefully regimented program" of
    denial, sarcasm, wetting the bed and smoking. He has claimed to have seen
    sexually provocative scenes since the age of 7 due to his parents' lack of
    awareness. Despite his forgiving nature he still holds a grudge against both
    of his parents for being absent-minded and not providing emotional support
    and tends to be bitter whenever talking about them. Season 1 Chandler in
    </p>
    <h2>Season 2</h2>

    Chandler feels incredibly guilty about telling Rachel how Ross was into her
    and at the same time telling Ross to find someone else, as Rachel realizes
    she has feelings for Ross and is devastated when Ross comes back to New York
    from his trip to China with Julie. He tries to tell Ross to reconsider going
    after Rachel but fails when Ross seems to be very content with Julie. When
    Ross finally finds out Rachel has feelings for him, he suggests Ross to make
    a pros and cons list about Rachel and Julie to help him decide. Ross
    ultimately picks Rachel but as she is visiting the apartment, the list
    automatically starts printing out of nowhere and breaks Rachel's heart.
    Chandler blames himself for the whole fiasco but is overjoyed when Ross and
    Rachel finally hook up. Once, while babysitting Ross' son Ben, Chandler and
    Joey get distracted while flirting with some women on a bus and leave Ben on
    the vehicle. They go all over the city looking for Ben and finally find him
    at the Human Services office. Ross is infuriated with the pair. Chandler is
    extremely furious when Monica tells the rest of the group about his third
    nipple. He once accepts Monica's help to lose weight but gets annoyed when
    she wakes him up on a Sunday and playfully calls him "fat boy". He and Joey
    are increasingly impressed by Monica's boyfriend Richard and spend a lot of
    time with him. At the end of Season 2, he meets a woman online and gradually
    falls in love with her. They decide to meet up at Central Perk and it turns
    out to be Janice. Season 3 Season 3 starts with Chandler being in a
    passionate relationship with Janice. This is the only time where he doesn't
    intend to break up with her, and is genuinely in love with her and can
    overlook her seemingly annoying voice and laugh. When Joey finds Janice
    annoying as ever and expresses feelings of hatred towards her, Chandler
    tells him to suck it up and like Janice. Initially in his rekindled
    relationship with her, he experiences his trademark commitment-phobia and
    freaks her out by proposing they move in together. He later amends this by
    reassuring her that it's just his instinctive nature to freak out about
    commitment. After learning Janice has kissed her ex-husband twice since they
    have been in a relationship, and subsequently the fact that she still loves
    him as well as Chandler, he reluctantly lets her go as they have a shot at
    being a family, and he reflects on how he felt about the man who "broke his
    family up", as he saw it, when he was a kid. After the breakup he has a
    tough time getting over her but feels a little better after playing football
    with his friends on Thanksgiving and being chosen over Joey by a beautiful
    Dutch woman. Later on, his sadness resurfaces and he ends up kissing one of
    Joey's sisters, Mary-Angela, at a party. He tells Joey (to protect himself)
    that he might be in love with Mary-Angela and it wasn't just him messing
    around. When Mary-Angela gets excited, he goes over to the Tribbiani family
    home to gently break up with her, but it turns out Joey is there too, as
    well as all of the other Tribbiani sisters. Chandler genuinely doesn't know
    which one Mary-Angela is, and, when one of the sisters makes a pass at him
    in the hall, he assumes he has found her... but it turns out to be another
    sister, Mary-Therese. An altercation occurs, and when Joey realizes the
    truth he is pretty mad at Chandler. Chandler apologizes profusely, telling
    him he will never do anything of the sort again. When Ross joins Chandler
    and Joey in a bar just after Ross has gone on a break from Rachel, Chandler
    tells him to call Rachel so that he can work past whatever trouble they were
    having as a couple. Ross then hears Mark's voice in the background, gets the
    wrong impression and sleeps with the girl from the Xerox place, Chloe. After
    learning he slept with Chloe, Chandler tells Ross to not tell Rachel about
    it and also erase any evidence of  
    <h2>season3</h2>
    she asks Chandler to scare Gary with his trademark commitment fear. Here we also find
    out that Chandler has a reputation of dropping things specially while he's
    being asked to catch something. As this season comes to a close, Chandler
    gets into a fight with Joey who gets a lead in a very sketchy movie that
    doesn't guarantee him any money. Joey believes Chandler is not believing in
    his career and throws him out while they're going on the road trip to Vegas.
    Joey later forgives Chandler and asks him not to come because he doesn't
    want to prove Chandler right. Chandler and Monica regardless plan to go to
    Las Vegas to celebrate their one-year anniversary as a couple when Phoebe
    tags along and Ross and Rachel are scheduled to reach the next day. After
    learning that Monica had lunch with Richard earlier and wasn't planning on
    telling him about it, he gets upset but later Monica assures him that she
    won't see Richard again reuniting them. While the couple gets gambling
    fever, Chandler tells Monica that they could get married if she rolls a hard
    eight (roll four with two dices) she promptly agrees but they reconsider
    when they see Ross and Rachel run out of the wedding chapel in The One In
    Vegas.
